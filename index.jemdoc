== Biography \[[https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~hzhang/others/cv_zhanghang.pdf Resume\/CV]\]\[[https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~hzhang/others/research_summary.pdf  Research Summary]\]

Hang Zhang is currently a second year M.Phil student in Department of Computer Science \& Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). 
He is supervised by Prof. [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~fyyoung/ Evangeline F. Y. Young] and co-supervised by Prof. [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Bei Yu]. 
Before that, he received the B. Eng degree from [http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/ Sichuan University (SCU)] in 2015, under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.scu.edu.cn/eie/faculty/webinfo/2010/10/1286178494662243.htm Xiaohai He].

He was selected into the talents project ({{<font color="red"> Top 0.1%</font>}}) in [http://jwc.scu.edu.cn/wyz/ Wu Yuzhang Honors College] at SCU, and he received various contest awards and scholarships in his undergraduate study; He also received full postgraduate studentship and {{<font color="red">Best Paper Award Nomination</font>}} from [http://www.ispd.cc/ ISPD 2017] at CUHK.

He started his research in VLSI CAD\/EDA in August 2015. His main research interests include but are not limited to machine learning and its applications in design for manufacturability and physical design. 
He is also interested in machine learning theory and its applications in the related areas, such as robotics, computer vision, and data mining. 
# He is also interested in machine learning theory and its applications, such as robotics and computer vision, other advanced topics in machine learning, such as online learning and optimization.
